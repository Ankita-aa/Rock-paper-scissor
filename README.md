# Detecting hand gesture in Rock-paper-scissor Game using YOLOv11

This project implements a real-time Rock-Paper-Scissors game using YOLOv11 for hand gesture detection. The game runs in Google Colab.

## Running in Google Colab
Open this Colab notebook.
Replace the API_KEY with your own from Roboflow.
Run all cells to start.

## Dataset
The dataset was created using Roboflow.
It contains labeled images of hands showing Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
To use the dataset, you must generate your API key from Roboflow and replace it in the notebook.

## Tech Stack
YOLOv11 (Ultralytics) for real-time hand gesture detection
Google Colab for running the game
OpenCV for image processing
Roboflow for dataset management
Fine tuning
